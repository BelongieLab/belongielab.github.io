Welcome! Our lab carries out research in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, exploring problem areas including fine-grained analysis of multimodal data, self-supervised learning, 2D/3D generative models, and augmented reality. 

Belongie Lab is founded and led by Prof. [Serge Belongie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ORr4XJYAAAAJ&hl=en). We have members and alumni from [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) (2001 - 2012), [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu/) and [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu/) (2013 - 2021), and [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/) (2021 - present).
